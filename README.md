## Tixy - An NFT based Event Ticketing Platform
Tixy is a blockchain-powered platform that revolutionizes the way event tickets are created, distributed, and managed. By leveraging NFTs (non-fungible tokens), Tixy ensures that every ticket is unique, traceable, and secure, solving common problems like fraud and ticket counterfeiting.

## Core Features
**Event Organizers:**  
  Tixy allows event organizers to mint event tickets as NFTs. Each ticket is unique, verifiable, and stored on the blockchain, ensuring authenticity.
  **Users:**  
  Users can purchase tickets, which are stored securely in their crypto wallets, providing easy access and ownership of their tickets.
  **Secondary Market:**  
  Tixy enables a secondary market where users can resell their tickets. Smart contracts ensure that event organizers receive royalty payments for every resale.
  **Fraud Prevention:**  
  Since tickets are tied to unique NFTs, duplication or selling counterfeit tickets is impossible, providing a secure environment for ticket buyers and sellers.
- **Perpetual Royalties:**  
  Event organizers earn perpetual royalties from the resale of tickets, with smart contracts automating the royalty distribution process.
