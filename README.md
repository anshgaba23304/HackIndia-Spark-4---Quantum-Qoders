## Tixy: Decentralized NFT-Based Ticketing System

**Tixy** is a blockchain-powered platform that revolutionizes event ticketing by utilizing NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) to create, distribute, and manage tickets securely and transparently. It addresses common issues like fraud, counterfeit tickets, and lack of royalty revenue from secondary market sales.

### Core Features

- **Event Organizers:**  
  Tixy allows event organizers to mint event tickets as NFTs. Each ticket is unique, verifiable, and stored on the blockchain, ensuring authenticity.

- **Users:**  
  Users can purchase tickets, which are stored securely in their crypto wallets, providing easy access and ownership of their tickets.

- **Secondary Market:**  
  Tixy enables a secondary market where users can resell their tickets. Smart contracts ensure that event organizers receive royalty payments for every resale.

- **Fraud Prevention:**  
  Since tickets are tied to unique NFTs, duplication or selling counterfeit tickets is impossible, providing a secure environment for ticket buyers and sellers.

- **Perpetual Royalties:**  
  Event organizers earn perpetual royalties from the resale of tickets, with smart contracts automating the royalty distribution process.
